DDCharacterSheet
================

A D&amp;D 3.5 character sheet, made using C++, Qt and SQLite.

To compile and run, just use the make command and run the CharacterSheet executable file.

If the compilation fails with the following error:
	"can't create bin/caracs.o: No such file or directory"
	just create two directories named respectively 'bin' and 'mocFiles' (or use the qmake command, they will be created).
